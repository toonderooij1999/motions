### Common ground along Dutch political parties
The ipynb file in this repository scrapes motions of the Dutch 'Tweede Kamer' and uses AI to find the parties that have the most in common. The scraping is not nessecary because a csv file for December 2020 is provided as well. This project is made for a subject in the third year of the AI Bachelor at the University of Amsterdam.
