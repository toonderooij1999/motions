### Common ground along Dutch political parties
The ipynb file in this repository scrapes motions of the Dutch <em>Tweede Kamer</em> and uses AI to find the parties that have the most in common. The scraping is not nessecary because a csv file for December 2020 is provided in <em>/data</em>. This project is made for the subject <em>AI for Society</em> in the third year of the AI Bachelor at the University of Amsterdam.
